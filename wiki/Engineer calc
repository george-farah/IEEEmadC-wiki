Description:

Engineer calc app Calculates quantities of building materials needed in a project
and calculates the cost of these materials

This application provides a set of data and information about building materials used in our 
Our diameter that are not available in other applications.

This application is aimed at a segment of general engineers and civil engineers in particular.
Or a project owner wants to calculate the cost of these materials in his project without consulting an engineer
 Any person who performs calculations of the quantity or cost of materials needed in construction


 using this app  reduces the time required by the engineer to calculate the quantities required for a project 
and by doing so accelerates other calculations who need to do..
At his cost, the project owner or anyone can use it to avoid possible monuments
By giving him a number of unreal cost by 
responsible persons
